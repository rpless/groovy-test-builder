TODOs:

Short Term:
    Support setup/teardown
    Get Hamcrest Matchers working inside an internal test case
    Build Script (maybe gradle or maven) [Done]

Longish Term:
    Migrate to using BuilderSupport (its not used right now, because I wasn't sure how to stop closures in the BuilderSupport from evaluating)
