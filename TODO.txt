TODOs:

Short Term:
    Support setup/teardown
    Get Hamcrest Matchers working inside an internal test case

Longish Term:
    Migrate to use BuilderSupport (its not used right now, because I wasn't sure how to stop closures in the BuilderSupport from evaluating)


Questions:
    Should the builder automatically run all of the tests or should it return a TestSuite?
