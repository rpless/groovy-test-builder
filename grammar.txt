The Grammar for the Testing DSL is as follows:

    <Suite>    = suite <String>, { <TestExpr> ... }

    <TestExpr> = <Unit>
               | <Setup>
               | <Teardown>

     <Unit> = unit <String>, Closure
     The Closure must have valid JUnit assertions in order to do anything meaningful.

     <Setup> = setup Closure
     <Teardown> = teardown Closure
     The setup and teardown are used for setting up and tearing down



Notes:
    Builtin types such as Strings are denoted as <String>
