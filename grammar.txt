The Grammar for the Testing DSL is as follows:

     <Suite> = suite <String>, { <TestExpr> ... }

    <TestExpr> = <Unit>

     <Unit> = unit <String>, Closure
     The Closure is assumed to have valid JUnit test assertions


Notes:
    Builtin types such as Strings are denoted as <String>
