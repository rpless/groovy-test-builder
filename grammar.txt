The Grammar for the Testing DSL is as follows:

     <Suite> = suite <String>, { <TestExpr> ... }

     <TestExpr> = unit <String>, Closure  ;; The Closure is assumed to have valid JUnit test assertions


Notes: ';;' indicates a comment
        Builtin types such as Strings are denoted as <String>
